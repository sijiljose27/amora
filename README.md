FUTURE SCOPES
Launch as an Ecommerce Platform: As of now this is only a website of our brand in future we are palnning to Launch an ecommerce platform is one of the most obvious future goals for the website for Amora scented candles. Customers would be able to explore and buy candles directly from the website in this case, which might greatly boost sales and revenue. To do this, ecommerce functionality, such as a shopping cart, secure checkout, and payment processing, would need to be added to the website.
Expand Product Line: Adding items other than candles to the Amora scented candles website's product line is a potential future development. Other home fragrance items like diffusers, room sprays and wax melts may fall under this category. The website might draw more visitors and boost sales from current clients by providing a greater selection of products.
Enhance User Experience: Increasing website user satisfaction is a potential future goal that could boost traffic and revenue. The website may need to be redesigned to be more aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly, it may need to be optimised for search engines, and it may need to have helpful material like descriptions of candle scents and care tips included.
Offer Subscription Services: Another potential future use for the website would be to offer subscription services for candles. Customers would be able to get regular candle shipments automatically, which would encourage repeat shopping and boost consumer loyalty.
Offer Customization: Providing candle customization options can help distinguish the brand and serve as a differentiator. Customers might be able to design their own label combinations, custom candle blends, and smell combinations on the internet.
Live chat bot and review posting will be added in future so that the website will be more user friendly
